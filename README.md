The example implementations provided will make more sense if you've read the book, however, it might be somewhat useful to you otherwise.

The purpose of this repository is to act as a practical reference for examples of how the algorithms mentioned in the book can be implemented.
This repository should not be consulted as the book is read page-by-page, but rather, when you're attempting to implement an algorithm or gain a more technical understanding from a programming perspective.
